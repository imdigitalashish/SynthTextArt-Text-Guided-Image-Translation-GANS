# Text-Guided-Image-Generation

Here I am just trying to implement this paper from scratch -> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf

You can also try it out, It's a fun paper and trying to get that thing on Anime Images Colouring, Ofcourse you can expand this to a number cases as you wish !! 

Dataset I am using as of now https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ktaebum/anime-sketch-colorization-pair


Steps for implementing this

- [x] Discriminator Model
- [ ] UNET in the paper and Generator Model
- [ ] Dataset Loading
- [ ] Training ( Most Boring Task )
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Paper Implemented ðŸ¥³
